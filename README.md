<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
<p align="center">I used to be a nurse before I became interested in tech and decided to jump into a brand new career. Now I'm a software engineer with a bright, shiny diploma to prove it! Recently graduated from BrainStation's SE bootcamp (and member of the winning team in the 24-hour industry project / hacakathon), I'm eager to keep building and learning everything I can.</p>
<p align="center">Right now I'm working on the next iteration of Reactive Minds, a platform for parents to learn about emotion regulation and help their kids learn to self-regulate more effectively. The first iteration was my capstone project for the bootcamp, and it didn't quite get where I envisioned before demo day so it isn't hosted yet but I plan to get it up very soon!</p>
